# Personal Development Plan
of Atanas Marinov group 82

## Develop a goal
### Strong points:
*	**I think, before I make a move** – when being in front of a problem, I prefer to look at it from all the different angles and then to approach it. I don’t like to perform an act without properly knowing what I am dealing with.  
*	**Organized** – I like to organize my work around the deadlines for it, by splitting it into smaller milestones, which follow the logical order of the task's completion  
### Weak points:
*	**Perfectionism** - I often tend to overcomplicate some simple stuff in my intention to make them perfect. Thus, I spend more time on some less important details, neglecting the core. 

*	**Used to work solo** - when I work in a team I don't really rely on my teammates. For example, I not only check my work for mistakes afterwards, but theirs too, which is not a bad thing in particular, but when the amount of work is too big this could be very exhaustive (especially if you focus too much on their details as of being perfectionist), which basically makes me lose track of my own tasks, resulting in my further work being not as productive as it should be.

## Plan to achieve my goal
### My goals:
*	**Get an overview of what working on a project really is** – understanding the structure of the process is essential, if you want to be successful in your future as a computer science student and later as a professional.

*	**Improve myself in**:

    * **Coding manner** – being able to use java for both front- and backend development, learn how the git system works, learn about synchronizing an application with a database.
	
    * **Personal manner** – being a better team worker, who can more easily rely on its team. Also, to be more open to communicate with my team in general.

### My current situation:
I have never done that big of a project, where I must synchronize my work with 6 other people. Most of my programming experience is just coding some methods, which are independent from each other, for the sake of practicing some newly learnt material. Therefore, I started reading about developing an app with java and the tools required for it.
### The options in front of me:
My options to learn how to be better code writer are either to learn myself - by reading different coding books or watching online tutorials, which could teach me to the correct tools, that I should use for this project, or to learn from other people - from my teammates, which will also help me to become better "teamplayer", or from the TA's.   

### My plan:
#### Improve my teamwork:
* Communicate more with my team;
* Believe in them more;
* Help my teammates, but only if they really need the help - don't distract them unnecessarily;

#### Improve my coding skills:
* Read books related to the topic;
* Watch relevant internet tutorials;
* Browse for libraries and frameworks, that might be useful in the future work, and then read their documentation;
* Learn more about git;
* Write more tests;
* Put more time into practice;
