# Personal Development Plan

This is the personal development plan of **Rahul Crunal Kalaria**, member of **group 82**.

#### My Strong Points 

* Goal-oriented 
	* I set a personal goal of getting a high grade in Computer Organisation. 
	* Managed to achieve this goal by making all the peer review assignments, brain-fuck and hashing assembly assignments. 

* Good Management skills
	* I have good communication skills along with great time management and problem solving skills
	* Having good communication skills and good at conflict management helped my team and i to achieve our goals during CO. 

#### My Weak Points 
* Taking too much responsibility
	* I often end up taking much of the workload during a project.
	* This results in over-stressing myself and not enough work left for teammates.

* Reluctance to ask for help
	* I often prefer to brute force my way through problems that i encounter rather than asking for help. 
	* This often leads to lost opportunity cost.

## Plan to achieve my goal

### My learning goals

* Understanding the workflow behind developing a software project and properly implementing it during this project. 
	* This is important because in the real world software projects are enormous and to successfully develop such a project, a strict and well coordinated workflow needs to be followed. 
	* I would have succeeded in achieving this goal when we successfully complete our project while making good use of GIT, task-division and task-Coordination.

* Further develop my knowledge of programming 
	* With every passing week new languages, library's, API's ect are released. Knowledge on how to actually use these new constructs can save a lot of time and effort. "Be lazy, do not try to reinvent the wheel".

### Reality (My current situation)

*At the moment i am trying to learn about various web API's that could help us during our OOP Project. 

*I am also learning what GIT has to offer as i believe GIT (or any version control system) is the backbone behind large software projects. 

*Im struggling a bit with understanding how to integrate WEB API's with our project. 

*I will try to overcome my reluctance to ask of help and request help from TA'S or team members. 

### Options 
* Options to achieve my goals are :
	* Google, YouTube, StackOverflow. looking for various resources online and learning from them
	* Requesting help from TA's more.
	* Request help from team members. 
	
* My habit of not asking for help is definitely stopping me from reaching my goal
