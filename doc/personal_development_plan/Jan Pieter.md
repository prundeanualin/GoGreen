__Step 1: Develop a goal__


My two strongest points are that I am always flexible with what I need to achieve and that I am honest with myself and others.

With flexibility I mean that I can adjust to different problems quickly, even if I don't really have an instant solution, I can always navigate around and find a way to solve the problem.
The honesty with myself sounds like a minor strong point, but I would like to differ. I know my limits and I know when to ask for help, this has helped me alot in TU Delft.

My two weakest points are again also my tendancy to be flexible by a problem and that I work without a scedule.

Because I like to switch whenever a problem, it often concurs that I jump to another problem, eventhough I could have solved the other problem by just working longer on it. 
Fortunatly I won't have a problem with working without a scedule, since the deadlines are strict so there will be no chance to procrasinate.


__Step 2: Create plan to achieve your goal__


Goal:
	My goal for this course is to enchance my Java skills and to learn Git (and to pass of course), because I don't feel like I am qualified enough to call myself a decent developer.

Reality:
	I am trying my best to pass the first year, right now I have failed W&D and A&D, so I will need to do better and start change my working routine.
Options:
	To achieve my goal, I have the following options:
		- Try to ask for help first on problems, before moving on another one.
		- Work on the project everyday, to reduce workload.

	I will try to use both options in order to get the best outcome as a part of the team.
Will:
	For now I will use both options and be clear to my teammates to achieve my goals.
	I get that it have some learning curve, since this is my first programming project, but I think that I can add to the team.
