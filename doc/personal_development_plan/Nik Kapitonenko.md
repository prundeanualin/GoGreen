Personal Development Plan (pdp) of Nik Kapitonenko from group 82.

#### Strong points:
 * Completion-driven
  * I will get work done in the end, I cannot just give up on something.
  * I also believe strongly in doing everything right from the first time, and while it may be slow, whatever my project is, it will be of good quality.
#### Weak points:
 * Procastinator
  * As typical of many people, because of 'just being smart' in high-school, my discipline is lacking, mainly in the form of severe procrastination.
 * Template-minded
  * I have trouble creating something without having clear instructions, I typically need a template to work from, or at least clear specifications on what is expected.  

### The plan for this course:

 #### Goal:
* Figure out how to properly work in a team, being able to fit into others schedules (that is stopping with procrastinating stopping procrastinating)
* Learn the required tools needed for this course and get a feel for 'proper' software development.
* Get experience in various topics from doing this project that can be used for when I work on my personal projects.
		
	#### Current Situation:
* I have only amateur experience in working with some technologies and languages from personal projects and the courses at the TU.
* I have only worked seriously in software development alone, and as such don't know how to develop in a team setting.
* Similarly, I tend to search my questions online more that asking others for help.
		
	#### Current Options
* Currently I have access to the usual websites like StackOverflow and Google, but this time I will know what to search for.
 * This in the end will probably be my most used resource.
* There are obviously lectures too I can and will attend.
	
	#### Motivation:
* As usual, I will try to get a working product done before the deadline, as usual. While I normally would begin later than I should,  I hope having a team gives me more intermediate deadlines to keep me on track. The scrum board and other planning methods should also help me plan out the project better.
