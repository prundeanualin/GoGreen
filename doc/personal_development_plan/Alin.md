What are two of my strong points and how do they show in a team?

I am an ambitious and thourough person who aims to achieve the best out of this project while coordinating myself with my teammates.Once i decided upon an objective i manage to gather all my strengths and see that objective fulfilled, just like i did with the Comouter Organisation bonus projects where I picked one of the hardest assignment subjects and, despite stumbling a lot of times, I kept my determination to finish the project.

What are two of my weaker points and how do they show in a team?

In the meantime, I also have a weakness in finding myself carried away and trying to tackle all the tasks myself, losing track of a distributed workload among my teammates.Also, I happen at often times to procrastinate and this ends up in losing the working pace of my team and finding myself behind the schedule, ultimately building up interesting quantities of stress and anxiety regarding my performance.

G:
I aspire to develop my cooperating skills and be able to create a dynamic and effective workflow between me and my team, as well as to grasp as much experience as possible about this project and making such applications from scratch in the future.It would be the most rewarding for me to have a thriving progress during my time here and to improve myself by learning from those that are better than me in a specific subject, while also enjoying to know and think about other perspectives and ideas brought up by my partners.The milestone of this achievment will be once our project is in its final most pleasant form, after having had a fun experience with my team members while developing it.
R:
My goals are on top of my priority list and I might even say that our team had a good start the first and so far only time we met to work for this project, as we helped each other to finish the task assigned for our first meeting, having those who finished sooner helping those that seem to stumble a bit.Despite all of those, I believe I can still work on sticking up to the schedule and to avoid wasting precious time.
O:
In order to fulfill my goals, I forsee one possible option to have our project done and packed up as a visionary end product, while also having shared meaningful moments with my teammates.Firstly, I will look up for similar projects so I could make an idea of the application's architecture and layout, following the creation of a sketch for our plan and all its smaller, more manageble steps, all this time also ensuring the quality of our team communication is at its highest, considering both its efficiency and its level of entertainment.

W:
My plan of action consists of a fine tuning process for my working schedule, so I can best avoid procrastinating, and of a careful inspection of our project's smaller objectives so we can start assigning specific tasks to each member of our group right away.I hope me and my partners will find the best common rhythm for the individual pace of each one uf us and manage to cooperate successfully,eventually finding time for fun activities as well.
