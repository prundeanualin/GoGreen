## Plan to achieve my goal

  * Being able to handle the tasks assigned to me and realize at least one cool feature will be a success to me.

* Learn how to communicate and cooperate with team members effectively

  * Survive the project and not all my teammates hate me is good enough for me.

#### My current situation

I've been working hard towards my goals, and efforts have been made including training my language skill with a native speaker, doing some coding challenge online, and learning the materials on BrightSpace carefully, etc. My coding ability is growing and I'm able to do way more stuff than "Hello world" now. While my communication skills still need to be improved.

#### My options

Basically, the best option of achieving my goal is to learn from my teammates. Other options maybe learning from TA's feedback, watching bunch of tutorials on Youtube and other website, etc. Not being able to communicate effectively is one of the things to work on as well as the major obstacle to achieving my goal. Among the options, learning from my teammates is definitely the one I want to use most.
