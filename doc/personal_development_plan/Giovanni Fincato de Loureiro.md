# My personal development plan
G.FincatodeLoureiro@student.tudelft.nl
## Goal development:
My goal is to attain experience with working on a group programming project, as this is a new skill for me to learn. I will learn to coordinate tasks among group members. I will also expand on my Java knowledge from making on ly basic, general text applications to an actual application that can be used. My strong points are being able to communicate effectively with a group and understand why each task is done the way it is, while my weak points are that I have very little experience with making Java applications (other than what was covered in the OOP course)
Goals set:
* Communicate effectively with team members to make tasks more manageable, without putting too much or too little work on any particular person
* To learn how to understand team members' weaknesses and strengths and use this to make workload more efficient
* To not only enhance my programming knowledge in Java, but also broader design concepts of applications and user interface
* To learn more intricately the programming methods in Java and its libraries and tools
These goals are specific, manageable, assignable, relevant, and time-based, making them effective personal objectives for this project. They are also based on personal development and improving my ability as a programmer and team member. The goals can be measured individually by how well the team is able to coordinate and how well I fit in with the workload, how much knowledge I have gained in Java application development, and how good the final project is.
## Reality:
The project is only in the very initial stages, but my team is already coordinating effectively in the first 2 tasks of uploading a picture and our personal development plans.
## Options:
I can either do my own research independent of the group on how to do a group programming project, or I can learn from my teammates (who may have more experience than I do) on how to do this. I will probably be using both options in order to develop myself towards my goals.
## Will:
To reach my goals I will have to
* Start communicating with my team members, and an immediate step would be to create message groups among us so we can coordinate what we do
* Read up more on programming techniques (especially group-oriented)
* Practice on Java with the libraries and intricacies of the language
I will learn from my teammates as well, making them useful sources of information in achieving these goals.
