Sprint retrospective

# Jan
#### sprint 
For last weekâ€™s Spring review I believe that I promised myself to be more involved with the group and to contribute more by doing so. I believe that it went really well. Since I did the implementation for the vegetarian meal and finally contributed a branch that actually got used. And we also stayed together for Saturday in University with part of the group to make even more progress.

#### Problems encountered:
Unfortunately part of the code broke down while committing and pushing it, so Zhao offered to fix that issue and it was resolved within a few hours

#### Adjustments for next sprint:
What I would do better for next week, is being careful with what I do while committing; I noticed that one small mistake can ruin a whole bunch of code, fortunately I had a backup ready for this, so the issue was soon resolved, but preventing a code issue is better than fixing the issue.

#### Adjustments from previous sprint:
Did not underestimate tasks. I started them on time to avoid last minute complications. 

# Gio
### Problems encountered:
my understanding of the database connection to the server is limited so I was still not able to implement the database into the server, despite the database functionalities being complete

### Adjustments for next sprint:
less focus will be applied in the actual database xml for next week, since the functionalities are now completed. Instead, I will focus on making the API files compatible with the new database functionalities and schema

### Adjustments from previous sprint:
more work was done inside the database itself in order to achieve maximum functionality in the xml and stability through thorough testing

# Nik

### Problems encountered:
This week, being 'focused' on OOPP, I really lost track of everything else, so I need to actually acknowedge that there are other courses too.
	It shouldn't take me away from OOPP, but it is a mental struggle I need to overcome for myself.
	
	As said, both the server and client are heavily developed now, so I need stay alert and quickly react to all my tests breaking.

### Adjustments for next sprint:
Because the client and server are heavily worked on, my current tests will soon be non-covering or out-dated. Therefore, constant adjustment is needed.

### Adjustments from previous sprint:
I changed how logging works on the server, to make my tests easier to follow. PSA: Please use Log4j logger, not System.out.printLn.

# Alin

### Problems encountered:
There aren't any blocking to say that they might have held me back from delivering my work.

## Adjustments for next sprint:
Ask for help when needed with tasks so that the testing development can keep up with the rest of the project

### Adjustments from previous sprint:
Was focused on testing and able to spend a lot of time on it, did not procrastinate

# Atanas

### Problems encountered:
associated with the work with Jan. The reason behind them was a mistake I've made in previous commits, which cascaded in our later work.

### Adjustments for next sprint:
be more careful when writing code, especially when it is just a small tailoring.

### Adjustments from previous sprint:
optimised my work ro reduce redundancy.

# Rahul

### Problems encountered:
Did not encounter too many problems. 

### Adjustments for next sprint:
try to learn more about the GUI so i can help out with the GUI. 

### Adjustments from previous sprint:
I took a short break from coding to other members could have a chance to contribute more. 

# Zhao

### Problems encountered:
The code that I had written is hard to understand by teammates.

### Adjustments for next sprint:
Improving my code style, and write more comments to make the code more readable and sustainable.
### Adjustments from previous sprint:
Improved time efficiency, instead of pursuing a full understanding of everything, I tried to focus on the particular part which is needed for now.
