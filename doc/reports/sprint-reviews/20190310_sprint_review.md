Sprint retrospective

## Jan

### Problems encountered:
Misunderstood requirements of connecting GUI to client side, started too late and was unable to complete it

### Adjustments for next sprint:
Start tasks earlier so they can be complete by the time they are needed

### Adjustments from previous sprint:
Did not underestimate tasks and was able to find good research resources

## Gio
### Problems encountered:
Had a good database schema and framework for the project, but was unable to integrate it into spring 

### Adjustments for next sprint:
Research on Spring along with the database work to make integration of own work into the project possible

### Adjustments from previous sprint:
Knew to do better research on his task before starting work on database

## Nik

### Problems encountered:
Worked on connecting the GUI to the client, mostly successful but worked overlapped a lot with what other group members were working on

### Adjustments for next sprint:
Improve communication with group members so that multiple people do not end up working on the exact same task (and thereby submitting 2 versions of the same thing)

### Adjustments from previous sprint:
Was able to learn spring well fromt he other group members and understood how to do the task he worked on

## Alin

### Problems encountered:
Was unable to keep the testing speed up with the rest of the Spring server development, was only able to test older parts of the code

## Adjustments for next sprint:
Ask for help when needed with tasks so that the testing development can keep up with the rest of the project

### Adjustments from previous sprint:
Was focused on testing and able to spend a lot of time on it, did not procrastinate

## Atanas

### Problems encountered:
Spent too much time fixing minor issues with the current GUI and so was unable to submit a GUI with new features

### Adjustments for next sprint:
Improve ability to work on new features and not focus too much time on minor issues

### Adjustments from previous sprint:
The issues fixed only had to be fixed once, did not have to repeatedly return and fix a previously functional inconsistency 

## Rahul

### Problems encountered:
Was unable to fully implement security into the server due to focusing on other project tasks

### Adjustments for next sprint:
Better communicate among group members in order to coordinate tasks for each individual

### Adjustments from previous sprint:
Time management was effective and procrastination was kept to a minimum, maximising work output into the project

## Zhao

### Problems encountered:
Pipeline used was unfit for the task and so a lot of time was spent on getting it to work rather than other tasks

### Adjustments for next sprint:
Research more before trying to implement a piece of the project which will takes up a lot of time, so that more of the project can be implemented

### Adjustments from previous sprint:
Everything worked on was efficiently done and ample time was given for the tasks, delivered on time
