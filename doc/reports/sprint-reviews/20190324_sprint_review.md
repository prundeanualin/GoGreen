Sprint retrospective

# Jan

#### Problems encountered:
Blocking issues that I have faced for this week were the fact that we changed to a more complex database, this by itself is a great chance of course. But it makes the connection between client/GUI with the database more difficult. I think however that I can manage to find this out completely before Monday 
For last sprint I believe that I promised that I would be more involved and work on several stuff. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to complete this since I needed to distribute part of my work and delete my old implementation on the server, to give Giovanni more code opportunity. 
For next sprint I will try to achieve a full understanding on implementing the transfer of every single possible entity. I believe that once I get this down, I will achieve all the front-end code that needs to be implemented. 

#### Adjustments for next sprint:
For next sprint I will try to achieve a full understanding on implementing the transfer of every single possible entity. I believe that once I get this down, I will achieve all the front-end code that needs to be implemented. 

#### Adjustments from previous sprint:

# Gio
### Problems encountered:
I am very new to javafx and GUI development so it was difficult for me to break the learning curve and be able to implement what I envisioned into the GUI

### Adjustments for next sprint:
By the next sprint the database should be entirely completed with no further changes whatsoever, and all focus should be put into GUI and server-side implementations

### Adjustments from previous sprint:
Small changes to the database format, as well as the fact that I have now mostly worked on GUI implementation rather than only on the database

# Nik

### Problems encountered:
-To fix certain bugs (both small things and SEVERE SECURITY BREACH ones), it is needed to change how certain endpoints work. This may break the client, and so I need to get a good talk with everyone about the endpoints.
		-In that regard, I really need to communicate better, I practially went offline this week.

### Adjustments for next sprint:
-pick up the pace. Just because you have done a few things 2 weeks ago, does not mean you can slack off now.
		-especially since we are now making the final product, and are now in the stage where we (or at least me, in regards to the server) are fixing existing code.

### Adjustments from previous sprint:
-To fix communications errors where 2 people work on the same thing:
		-there was backwards progress in that because I have only started on friday. If everyone would get their stuff done during the weekdays, I could write my tests and do clean-up after everyone is done, as well as giving me time to focus on other courses for once. While focusing on other courses was great (I never thought I would enjoy linear algebra that much), I did not expect that everyone would commit around friday/saturday, so I had to re-learn our architecture and redo my multiple times (it isn't much, but still).

# Alin

Considering this week's productivity for my plan regarding our project
improvements, I'd rather say it went relatively satisfying all the way. I wanted to
get the testing to it's finest level, so that the code coverage is almost perfect for the
client side and I did (excluding the new changes brought to the client logic, which
haven't been fully tested yet). Also, I started implementing the achievements
feature in our app by almost finishing the design for most badges. Next, I'll deal
with inserting those 2 pictures per achievement(one gray and one colored) into the
GUI frame and finally connecting them to the design logic of showing them once a
user manages to earn that specific achievement. I did not manage to finish
everything I wanted though, as I underestimated the required time for finishing
such tasks. From now on, I will be more reserved when deciding upon the amount
of time I need to deal with this kind of tasks. 

# Atanas

### Problems encountered:
During the week I was having a few blocking issues related to the flow when switching between pages.
I have managed to fix some of them, but this process took more than the expected time. Then when I was discussing it with the team, they had an ideas of how to fix them and after Zhao's finest help everything is now working as expected.

### Adjustments for next sprint:
Adjustment that I will take for the future is to discuss my blockings with my team more frequently.

### Adjustments from previous sprint:
Adjustment from before was that I was more concentrated on the global picture than the small details, which saved me some time and made me able to complete all of my tasks (excluding the minor inconsistencies mentioned above).

# Rahul

### Problems encountered:
Communication issues with the database guys caused deplayed in my work. 

### Adjustments for next sprint:
Improve communication with database guys to reduce time wastage. 

### Adjustments from previous sprint:
I learned took out time to learn how the GUI is constrtucted and learned about each component that goes into making our GUI possible. Also learned about how exacly our GUI and client interact with eachother. With this knowladge i am not in a possition to also help out and give ideas about the GUI.

# Zhao

### Problems encountered:
1. Because the new DB is designed separately, it's not 100% matching with the client side. Further adjustments need to be done.
2. Time is limited because we still have two other courses.

### Adjustments for next sprint:
1. everything is working well for me so no adjustment.

### Adjustments from previous sprint:
1. I have written a lot more comments to help my teammates understand the code. 
2. No longer try to do everything by myself, instead of it, I trust my teammates that they can handle their job.
