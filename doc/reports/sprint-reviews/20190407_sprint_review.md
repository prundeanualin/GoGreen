Sprint retrospective

# Jan

#### Problems encountered:
Alot of worrying about the upcoming week and extra workload, also I have been sick for a whole week.
#### Adjustments for next sprint:
Stress less, sleep more.
#### Adjustments from previous sprint:
Nothing much really, too focused on the upcoming exams.

# Gio
#### Problems encountered:
The source of problems within the database code are frequently very difficult to locate, making fixing the issue more difficult. 

#### Adjustments for next sprint:
More experience with the database is required. Create a "map" on paper of which updates/inserts trigger which, etc. That way any issue within the database should be easier to locate for both myself and the rest of the team

#### Adjustments from previous sprint:
Investing less time into GUI development and much more in making sure the database is fully functional and bug-free by reviewing code and lots of testing.

# Nik
#### Problems encountered:
Burnout? Depression? I am not sure, but this week I felt horrible and did basically nothing. Nothing For OOPP, Nothing for IDM, and basically nothing for Linear Algebra. Only by yesterday (april 6) I went back online and started doing misc. work.

##### Adjustments for next sprint:
I see more and more 'questionable' (legacy thing here, unusual inconsistent there, etc) code, and while it works, I do think I need to future-proof everything I can find, without making it worse. The last bit will be the hard part, as it can easily screw others over if not done well.
So, I just need to get to work (but also make sure I don't feel like crap)

#### Adjustments from previous sprint:

Nothing positive.

# Alin

Considering the tasks I had in mind for the past week, I must say that I successfully got them
done and even managed to handle another task, as I fixed some issues with the Solar Panel
feature, where client side wasn’t properly managing the http request to server. Only issue I
stumbled upon was that I wanted to achieve more and be even more efficient, which might
still require more focus and experience until I am able to get there.

# Atanas

 1. Throughout the week I have faced a small issue regarding the TableView in achievements.
 2. -
 3. I improved my self-learning. I feel way more comfortable reading documentation and searching for information that I need in general.
