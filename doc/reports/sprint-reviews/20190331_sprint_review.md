Sprint retrospective

# Jan

#### Problems encountered:
- This week I made the implementation for a several transfers, this went well but I noticed that 

#### Adjustments for next sprint:
- I should further enhance my knowledge on the project, since I only know the basics of the server, since I have been focusing on the client.

#### Adjustments from previous sprint:
- Since the database got changed there were some changes to our client code, at first I didn't fully understand on how I was going to manage this. But Zhao's code made me see how I should receive and send data through the client.  

# Gio
#### Problems encountered:
Had difficulty finding the location of several resources withing the database url's, making me unable to connect several pieces of information into the user screen. Several of the database triggers worked sligthly different than expected, a different approach had to be taken for testing the database

#### Adjustments for next sprint:
Further understanding of testing database triggers to help insure there will never be calculation errors after server input, as well as finding resource locations within database fetching url's

#### Adjustments from last sprint:
Due to more understanding of javafx and how the GUI works, I was able to do more work on the GUI quicker. The database is also much more stable and the triggers are set so that changes to the functionalities of the application are easier to implement into the calculations

# Nik
#### Problems encountered:
The server grows, and so the amount of tests. I find more and more bugs, questionable desisions, and things that I feel I really need to fix.
This eats my (free) time and my sanity. At the same time, I don't know how to proceed myself. Should I change this, that, or leave it. I feel terrible.

#### Adjustments for next sprint:
I honestly don't know. The project is 'done' (it is week 8 after all), so the only thing I/we can really do is wait for bonus features, missed features, and unexpected bugs, and get ready to fix them.
Okay, we still have to do 'gamefication', but honestly the term is so vague, the current leaderboard can count as this.

#### Adjustments from previous sprint:
While I did do some proper work this week (+700 changes in 1 commit!) , I think I could (as usual) do better. This time, it is just that I am stressed out, fed up, and this hampers my productivity.
I need to watch my sanity.

# Alin
Considering the plans I aimed to work on and eventually to get them done, I must say that I find myself almost satisfied with the results of my work. From three task I had in plan for this week, I managed to get 2 of them completely done (testing the client and adding the user profile photo functionality) and a third partially dealt with ( giving an icon for each achievement). As for why I wasn’t able to manage all three of them, it’s because I spend a lot of time on getting the small things as close to perfect, while ignoring the state of the big picture and how time consuming that might be.
For the future, I plan to have a better overview on an action I want to get done and analyze how much time am I allowed to spend for details.

# Atanas
#### Problems encountered:
1. During this week I have encountered an issue related to the TreeTableView's multimedia column creation, which took me more than the expected time, but after looking for a while throughout a related topic, I have managed to do it (however it was later removed).
#### Adjustments for next sprint:
2. - 
#### Adjustments from previous sprint:
3. I think my communication with the team has improved over the last few weeks. For example, there was a change that needed to be done for the friends' functionalities, which was mainly affecting the GUI. After a neat discussion, the work was well partitioned and therefore the problem took hardly any time at all.

# Rahul

1)	Blocking issues :
●	I had some trouble learning about Flutter and Dart as they are new languages and there are very little resources online for them. 
●	Wasted alot of time in trying to understand and design a good UI 


2) Adjustments for next sprint : 
●	Ask team mates who are more “artistic” than me for help. 
●	Try not to take on such a big task alone. 

3) Adjustments from previous sprint : 
●	I managed to find work which did not infringe upon any other teammates work. I did this as others felt like there was not enough work left. 

# Zhao
#### Blocking issues

1. None

#### Adjustments from previous sprint

1. Improved coding efficiency by improving the code reusing rate as much as possible. 
2. Pay more attention to exception handling.
3. Read teammates' code more carefully and learned some useful coding skills from the code. 

#### Adjustments for next sprint

 1. keep improving my coding style.
 2. improve time efficiency.
