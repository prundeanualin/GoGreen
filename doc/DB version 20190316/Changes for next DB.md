### Changes for next database version:
* userid will no longer be generated by the database for each user, instead username will become the primary key
* consequently, all records/achievements/friends tables will use the username for identification rather than a userid
* friends_list table will no longer be used. Instead only friend_add table will record friend additions, server side will generate a friends list based on queries to friend_add
* user login insert will be used in the insert_history table to register a login and update all automatic 'universal' triggers whenever a user logs in
* username foreign keys will be implemented into records/friends/achievements table (to be done when database is online with navicat)
* different types of temperature changes (besides the current waterheater_off) will be inserted into raw data and calculations/inserts associated will be implemented
* nationality field in user table will be removed
* triggers which restrict input (not adding self as friend, etc.) will be removed, future triggers made assuming data from server is always valid and correct
