My task this week was to implement the remaining implementations on the client-side; mainly the AddTree-implementation.

### Alin:
Last week I planned to implement the whole functionality behind the process of uploading
the user profile pic and retrieving it in order to show it on each client screen that requires it.I
also wanted to get the achievements page to its fully functional state, where each
achievement has its describing picture in front of it, which I successfully managed to
do. Next, as always, I took care of the testing process for the client side.
### Atanas:
1) My task this week was to complete the achievementsâ€™ screen, to improve the user screen created by Giovanni and all of its the page switching functionalities and popups related to it.

### Zhao:
1. Fixing any bug that can be found in the application.

### Giovanni:
Database implementation is nearly complete in terms of functionality, so more database testing with the server needs to be conducted in possibly unforseen conditions (e.g. two of the same type of tree, updating current values, etc.)
