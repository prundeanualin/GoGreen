## Sprint for individual members

### Nik:
- update the existing server tests;
- add debug logging on the controllers
- add (simple) auth preventing other users accessing others info

### Rahul:
* Completely re-write the server to match with our new DB
* Re-write the controllers and make them more uniform and consistent with outputs 
* write small simple tests for server. 

### Jan:
This week I planned to do implementation for the server- and client-side. Currently I am only working on the client-side however, this is because Giovanni also needed to have some code coverage on the project (in the sense of Java code). So now I am solely focusing on the client. The implementation need to be done differently now though, but further details about my blocking issues and adjustments will be given in the Sprint Review. 

### Alin:
For this week, I had 2 tasks I took upon. First one represented a successful testing of our project's client
side, with code coverage as close to 100 as possible. Second part of the plan was to deal with
achievments section in our app, to get the images ready and to implement the functionality behind
showing and offering badges to different users

### Atanas:
My task this week was to complete the views for all the basic screens, from add an activity, and most of the gamification screens. During this process I have also improved the basic design of the app and fixed the resizing of the windows.

### Zhao:
1. Until Demo 2, the switching between different pages of our application are mainly stage switching, which will cause some problem including flashing while switching and the new window will go back to the origin no matter where you have moved the previous window to. To solve this problem and optimize the page flow, I will do some restructuring to replace stage switching with root node switching. 
2. Since we are working on new GUI and Database, I need to connect the GUI to the client-side backend functionalities, and further connect it to the server.
3. Keep optimizing code quality including get rid of horrible long methods and redundant code.  Adding exception handler and data validator to realize a better stability of the application.
